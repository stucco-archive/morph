*Morph* is a framework and domain-specific language (DSL) that helps parse and
transform structured data. It currently supports several file formats
including XML, JSON, and CSV, and custom formats are usable as well.

Documentation
-------------

You can read the [user guide](http://stucco.github.io/morph) or go
through the [Scaladoc](http://stucco.github.io/morph/latest/api). I
suggest going through the user guide. The Scaladoc can get a little scary.

A Word of Warning
-----------------

The DSL and the rest of the framework is still in development! The API
may change dramatically before the final release.
