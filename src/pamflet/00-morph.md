Morph
=====

*Morph* is a framework and domain-specific language (DSL) that helps parse and
transform structured documents. Morph currently supports several file formats
including XML, JSON, and CSV out of the box, and custom formats are usable
as well.

> Morph is hosted on [GitHub]($githuburl$).
> Morph is currently at version $version$. Morph uses Scala $scala$.

This resource is intended to be a user guide to help you learn the basics
of *using* Morph. It is **not** an API reference, and it is **not** a
tutorial on programming in Scala. For complete coverage of the API, please see
the Morph [Scaladoc]($scaladocurl$). For an excellent Scala
tutorial, see [Twitter Scala School](http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/).
